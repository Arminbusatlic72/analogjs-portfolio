description: "Developed a custom WordPress plugin that integrates AI-powered document analysis. The plugin collects user emails and uploaded PDFs, sends them to a Python server that converts PDFs to text, then forwards the text to a language model agent to generate intelligent responses. It also adds PDFs to the WordPress media library and allows admins to configure server URLs and prompt templates via the WordPress dashboard."
