description: "Development of the official web shop for a leading craft brewery in the region using WordPress and WooCommerce. Migrated the site to WooCommerce from a previous platform, ensuring SEO links were preserved through proper redirects. The store features over 150 products and supports multiple languages with the WPML plugin. Optimized web performance through image compression and caching plugins, and migrated the site to a production environment. Integrated payment processing with Banca Intesa. The website is hosted on shared hosting, and the design was fully converted into a WordPress site. I continue to update and maintain the site, adding new features upon request."
