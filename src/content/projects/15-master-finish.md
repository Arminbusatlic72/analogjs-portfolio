description: "This website is developed at the end of 2019 using a boilerplate that incorporated Bootstrap 4, Pug/Jade, SCSS, Webpack, and Vanilla JS. For backend functionality, I integrated PHP Mailer to handle contact form submissions. The site was built for a US-based small construction company and features an embedded Facebook feed on the front page, along with a functional contact form. The design process was handled in Figma, ensuring a modern and responsive layout."
