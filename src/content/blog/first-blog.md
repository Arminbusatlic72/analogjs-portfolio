# Next.js vs Gatsby: Choosing the Right Framework for Your Web App

If you're deliberating between Next.js and Gatsby for your web application, this article will help you understand the strengths and use cases of each framework. Both are popular React-based frameworks, but they serve different purposes and excel in different scenarios. This guide will delve into their features, advantages, disadvantages, and key differences to help you make an informed choice.

## What Is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source React framework developed by Vercel. It allows developers to build production-ready web applications with React by offering features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.

### Key Features of Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js pre-renders pages on the server for faster load times and improved SEO.
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Code is split by page, so only the necessary JavaScript is loaded, enhancing performance.
- **Simple Routing:** File-system-based routing means any JS file in the `pages` directory automatically becomes a route.
- **Built-in CSS Support:** Support for CSS and Sass out-of-the-box, with stylesheets compiled and bundled automatically.
- **API Routes:** Build API endpoints within the Next.js app, eliminating the need for separate server code.
- **Image Optimization:** Automatic optimization, lazy loading, and resizing of images for faster page loads.
- **Fast Refresh:** Retains component state during development for quicker iteration.
- **SEO-Friendly:** Static generation with SSR improves SEO with customizable metadata.
