# Angular Signals: Game Changer with NgRx Signal State

The front-end development landscape is evolving quickly, and Angular has consistently been a framework at the forefront of that evolution. With the introduction of Angular Signals, the game is changing for state management. Pairing Angular Signals with NgRx—the go-to state management library for Angular—opens new doors for developers, allowing for more efficient, reactive, and flexible applications.

In this blog post, we’ll dive deep into Angular Signals, explore how NgRx Signal State works, and why this combination is being hailed as a game changer.

## What Are Angular Signals?

At the core of Angular’s reactivity model lies change detection. Traditionally, Angular applications rely on change detection cycles that check every component for changes in the data model. While effective, this can sometimes lead to performance bottlenecks in large applications.
Angular Signals are a new addition to the framework that aim to optimize the way Angular handles state updates. A Signal is a reactive primitive that stores a value and can notify components when the value changes. The biggest advantage of Signals is their ability to trigger updates only in the places where data actually changes, eliminating the need for exhaustive change detection across the entire component tree.

### How Angular Signals Work

Declarative API: Signals come with an easy-to-use declarative API that lets developers define reactive state in a more controlled and efficient way.

Automatic Tracking: Once a signal is created, Angular automatically tracks which components rely on the signal's value, allowing for efficient reactivity.

Fine-Grained Reactivity: Unlike traditional change detection that checks entire components, signals only trigger updates to the exact parts of the DOM that rely on them.

This means that Angular’s new signal system helps improve performance and makes it easier to manage state in your application, especially in complex, data-driven applications.

## Introducing NgRx Signal State

NgRx has been the standard for managing state in Angular applications for years. With the addition of Angular Signals, NgRx has also evolved to introduce NgRx Signal State, which integrates signals into the existing NgRx framework.

NgRx Signal State leverages the power of Angular Signals to make state management more efficient and developer-friendly. Let’s explore the key benefits:

### 1. Simplified State Management

Traditional NgRx applications require quite a bit of boilerplate code: actions, reducers, effects, selectors, etc. This pattern is effective but can be overwhelming for smaller applications or features. With NgRx Signal State, you can manage state without needing all that boilerplate. You can define state using signals directly, making the management of small, isolated pieces of state much more intuitive.

```typescript
const countSignal = signal(0); // Simple signal-based state

function increment() {
  countSignal.set(countSignal() + 1);
}
```

This simplifies how state is declared, accessed, and updated.

### 2. Performance Benefits

Since signals are reactive primitives that update only when their value changes, you get fine-grained reactivity for free. Components that rely on signal-based state are only re-rendered when the specific signal changes, which can greatly improve performance in large applications.

Traditional NgRx selectors, which recompute values each time the store updates, can now benefit from signals by caching values and preventing unnecessary recomputations.

### 3. More Readable Code

With fewer moving parts (like actions and reducers), NgRx Signal State code tends to be cleaner and easier to read. This is particularly important when working in teams or with legacy codebases where complex state management logic can quickly become difficult to maintain.

### 4. Fine-Grained Control Over Updates

In traditional NgRx, the state is managed globally, and changes in one part of the state can trigger updates in unrelated parts of the application. Signals give you more control over when and how updates happen, allowing for more predictable state updates and fewer unintended side effects.

For instance, instead of watching the entire store for changes, a component can subscribe to just one signal, ensuring that updates are contained and isolated.

### 5. Backward Compatibility

One of the best parts about NgRx Signal State is that it is backward-compatible with traditional NgRx. This means that you don’t have to rewrite your entire application to start benefiting from signals. You can introduce signals incrementally, in the parts of your app that will benefit most, and continue using traditional NgRx where it makes sense.

This gives you the flexibility to adopt signals at your own pace without the pressure of a full migration.

## How to Use Angular Signals with NgRx

First, create a signal to manage a piece of state. In this case, we’ll manage a simple counter:

```typescript
import { signal } from "@angular/core";

const counter = signal(0);

function increment() {
  counter.set(counter() + 1);
}
```

### Step 2: Connect Signals to Your Component

Next, connect the signal-based state to your Angular component:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "app-counter",
  template: `
    <div>
      <p>Counter: {{ counter() }}</p>
      <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class CounterComponent {
  counter = counter;

  increment() {
    this.counter.set(this.counter() + 1);
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Use NgRx Signal State for Larger Apps

When your application grows in complexity, you can integrate NgRx Signal State with your existing store to manage global state. Use NgRx actions and selectors with signal-based state to efficiently manage large datasets or complex app logic.

```typescript
import { createAction, props, Store } from "@ngrx/store";

// Define an action to increment the counter
const incrementAction = createAction("INCREMENT");

// Define a signal-based selector
const selectCounterSignal = (store: Store) => signal(store.select("counter"));

@Component({
  selector: "app-counter",
  template: `
    <div>
      <p>Counter: {{ counterSignal() }}</p>
      <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class CounterComponent {
  counterSignal = selectCounterSignal(this.store);

  constructor(private store: Store) {}

  increment() {
    this.store.dispatch(incrementAction());
  }
}
```

## Why You Should Consider NgRx Signal State

NgRx Signal State offers a natural way to scale your application without introducing unnecessary complexity. Whether you're managing state for a small component or a large-scale application, signals provide a scalable solution.

### 2. Improved Performance

By focusing on fine-grained reactivity, Angular Signals ensures that only the parts of the DOM affected by state changes are updated. This leads to faster, more performant applications, especially in complex or data-heavy scenarios.

### 3. Ease of Use

Signals are intuitive to use. Developers familiar with reactive programming will find that working with signals and NgRx Signal State feels natural, thanks to its declarative API and predictable behavior.

### 4. Flexibility

The backward compatibility of NgRx Signal State ensures that you can adopt signals incrementally. Start with small components and gradually integrate signals into more complex parts of your app as needed.

## Conclusion

Angular Signals and NgRx Signal State are a powerful combination that can dramatically improve how you manage state in Angular applications. Whether you’re looking to simplify your code, improve performance, or make your app more scalable, signals offer a modern solution to these challenges.

As the Angular ecosystem continues to grow, we can expect signals to play an increasingly important role in the future of reactive development. If you haven't already, now is the time to explore what Angular Signals and NgRx Signal State can do for your projects.
